# NeoVim config

## Description
This is my attempt at somewhat usable (for me) [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) config

## Setup
I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to manage plugins, so you should just have to run `:PlugInstall`
to install all plugins

## Usage
Run `:PlugUpgrade` and `:PlugUpdate` to keep them plugins updated.
